# Fast-Food

The provided code is a Java program that simulates a fast food menu management system. It allows users to select meals, additions, and drinks from predefined lists and add them to a menu. The program also supports functionalities such as calculating the total price of the selected items, removing items from the menu, clearing the entire menu, and printing the current menu.

The program consists of three classes: Menu, FastFood, and the main class.

The Menu class represents the menu itself and contains an array to store the items, their prices, and other related information. It provides methods to add items to the menu, remove items from the menu, print the menu, clear the menu, and calculate the total price of the items.

The FastFood class contains methods to display the available meals, additions, and drinks to the user. It utilizes the predefined arrays of items and their prices. The class also includes a method to determine the length of the meals array.

The main class initializes instances of FastFood and Menu objects and implements the main logic of the program. It provides a menu for the user, allowing them to interact with the system by choosing options like adding items to the menu, calculating the total price, removing items, clearing the menu, and printing the current menu.

Overall, this code demonstrates a basic implementation of a fast food menu management system in Java, utilizing classes and arrays to organize and manipulate the menu items.
